# Rebase
Steps to make rebase. Assume we want to get all the changes from main (core) branch to our branch (not feature branch).
- Start rebase
- Resolve conflicts between main and our branch locally
- Continue rebasing
- Pull remote origin of my branch
- Resolve conflicts between main and remote origin of my branch
- Commit changes
- Push to remote origin of my branch
